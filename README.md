Arduino Office Sign
===================

My humble setup for driving a character LCD.

Hardware
--------

* Arduino with Ethernet capability
* [i2c LCD backpack](http://www.adafruit.com/products/292), so fewer wiring needed
* [20x4 character LCD](http://www.adafruit.com/products/498)
* [Ribbon cable](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10647)
